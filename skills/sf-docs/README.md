# sf-docs

Official Salesforce documentation retrieval guidance for `sf-skills`.

## What it is

`sf-docs` is now a **prompt-only skill**.

It gives a practical retrieval playbook for official Salesforce docs on the public web, especially when:
- `developer.salesforce.com` pages are JS-heavy
- `help.salesforce.com` pages return shell content
- the real answer is on a child page, not the guide homepage

## What it is not

This skill no longer includes:
- local corpus workflows
- indexing
- benchmark workflows
- helper CLI scripts
- PDF fallback guidance

## Use it for

- official Salesforce docs lookup
- hard-to-fetch Help articles
- Apex / API / LWC / Agentforce documentation grounding
- deciding when to follow child links from broad official guide pages
- rejecting weak results such as shells, landing pages, and third-party summaries

## Key idea

Keep retrieval:
- **official-source-first**
- **HTML-only**
- **targeted**
- **child-link aware**
- **strict about exact concept matching**
